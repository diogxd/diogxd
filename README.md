## Experience

**Software Engineer Intern** at **Dropbox Inc.**  
*May 2023 -- August 2023*  
Remote

- Created Python and Go tools with regular expressions for redacting personal identifiable information (PII) from internal data before passing it to third-party SaaS. Boosted issue detection and diagnosis efficiency for Dropbox developers.
- Enhanced PII filters, expanding scope by eight-fold. Developed an internal tool for effortless updating based on newly defined code errors.

**Launch Intern** at **Dropbox Inc.**  
*May 2022 -- August 2022*  
Remote

- Integrated Dropbox Dash with Todoist Rest API using Javascript and Ruby on Rails. My work enables users to search for their tasks, sections, and labels in Todoist.
- Integrated Dropbox Dash with Discord API using Javascript and Ruby on Rails. My work enables users to search for the Discord servers they are in, and the channels and members of said servers.
- Improved existing connections and tackled patterns and challenges in Command E's existing framework.

**Science Community Leader for PHY-131** at **Grinnell College Science Learning Center**  
*Jan 2022 -- May 2022*  
Grinnell, Iowa

- TA and student leader for General Physics I Workshop (PHY-131). Led weekly study sessions, provided feedback to the professor.

## Projects

**Evolution Simulation** | *Rust, WebAssembly, JavaScript, Canvas API, HTML*  
*Jun 2022*

- Implemented genetic algorithm and neural network from scratch in Rust and used them to simulate the evolution of birds.
- Compile and run the simulation in the web browser through WebAssembly, using JavaScript and Canvas API to make frontend and live animate the simulation.

**Iterative Hard Thresholding and Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding** | *Matlab, LaTeX*  
*May 2023*

- Researched and implemented IHT and NIHT algorithms, proving NIHT conditions of convergence with asymmetric restricted isometry constants.
- Compared IHT, NIHT, and OMP in empirical tests. Enhanced sparse signal recovery understanding.

**Currency Arbitrage Opportunity Finder** | *C++*  
*October 2022*

- Implemented Bellman-Ford algorithm to find negative cost cycles in currency graphs.
- Used the negative cost cycles to find arbitrage opportunities in currency exchange.

**Analysis of Duffing Oscillators** | *Python, Jupyter Notebook, LaTeX*  
*May 2022*

- Analyzed non-linear damped, driven harmonic oscillators with Duffing Equation.
- Employed Euler's method for numerical integration. Used MatPlotLib to generate graphs for the time series, phase spaces, and the Poincar√© sections of the analyzed systems.
